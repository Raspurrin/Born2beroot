# Born2beroot!

In this project we learn about system administration by utilizing a virtual machine. I used Debian without a graphical interface. We had to set up partitions in a certain way, using LVM and encryption. We had to implement a strong password policy, configure the sudoers file with strict rules, set up UFW, SSH and create a script including certain system information and use crontab to make it display every 10 minutes. 

This is what my monitoring script looked like with some fun ASCII art:
